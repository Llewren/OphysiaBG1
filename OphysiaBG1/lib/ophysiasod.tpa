  SAY BIO ~WWhen asked about her past, OPHYSIA winces before glossing over that she grew up in the slums of Waterdeep before a desire for a new life—and consequences for actions taken in her old one—drove her onto the road, where she eventually found herself in Daggerford, which she has called her home in the years since.

While she only spares a bitter word or two for the City of Splendors, the young bard seems to hum with energy when talking about Daggerford and the people she’s met there, though it is tinted with a degree of frustration, given that the Shining Crusade has prevented her return home.

Much to her own distaste, Ophysia has joined the Flaming Fist expedition and seems motivated to put a stop to crusade by your side.~

  SAY NAME2 ~Ophysia’s Buckler~
  SAY DESC ~This finely crafted buckler was gifted to Ophysia after rescuing a merchant caravan beset by hobgoblins north of Waterdeep. It serves as a reminder of the good she’s done in the world, and she keeps it close at all times. Ophysia skillfully incorporates the buckler into her fighting style, seemingly finding great joy in delivering it directly into people’s faces.

  The buckler was enchanted by the wizard Madri Fenthorne of Daggerford, as a personal favor to her closest friend.
