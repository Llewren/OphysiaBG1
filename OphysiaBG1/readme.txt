*** Ophysia NPC for BG:EE + SoD ***
***********************************

Author: Llewren
Version: 1.0
Platform: BG:EE

------------------
-- Introduction --
------------------

This mod adds a new companion to the game — Ophysia, a chaotic good half-elven Skald from Daggerford. She can be found in the Belching Dragon Tavern in Nashkel, sharing stories and drinks with the patrons. In Siege of Dragonspear, she can be found immediately in the city of Baldur's Gate.

Ophysia has time-based and scenery-based talks, banters, optional interjections, and a light romance path for female PCs in Siege of Dragonspear.

------------------
-- Installation --
------------------

Ensure that your game is updated to the latest version and unpack the archive into the main Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition folder, then run setup-OphysiaBG1 and follow the installation instructions. Starting a new game is recommended. If you are playing using Steam or GOG and have Siege of Dragonspear installed, make sure you download DLC Merger (by Argent77) or modmerge (by Scott Brooks) before downloading any other mods.

-- FAQ --
---------

Q: Why are the interjections optional?
A: With no interjections, Ophysia more closely resembles companions from the unmodded game. With them, she will have more content and react to events as they happen — though not to an egregious extent.

Q: Do I need Siege of Dragonspear to play this?
A: No! While Siege of Dragonspear is quite important to Ophysia's character, she is still a feature-complete companion without it.

Q: Is the mod EET compatible?
A: I've given no special care to ensure EET compatibility, but I likely will do in the future.

Q: Does Ophysia have player-initiated dialogue?
A: No.

Q: Is Ophysia's portrait is AI-generated?
A: Yes. While I generally frown upon the usage of AI-generated content, this mod is a non-profit product, and commissioning art is not within my budget at this time. When it is, expect to see more portraits for Ophysia.

Q: Where do I contact you about bugs or typos?
A: Find the thread for Ophysia on the Beamdog Forums and leave a comment or contact me directly at https://smolderingmodsbar.com/
