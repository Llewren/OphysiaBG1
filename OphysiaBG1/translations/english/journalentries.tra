I met a bard named Ophysia in Nashkel after hearing the finale to her tale of valor. She traveled south from Daggerford to investigate the iron crisis, and we agreed to join forces. Let's hope her sword arm is as quick as her wit.~

After speaking with Madri, a mage in the coalition camp and friend of Ophysia, she mentioned the possibility of improving Ophysia's buckler with her magic. All she needs is a few componentsâ€”a potion of fortitude and 500 gold, to be precise. If I'm interested, I should see her again with the necessary materials before we make our attack on Dragonspear.~
