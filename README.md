This mod introduces Ophysia Lorines, a half-elven chaotic good Skald that you can add to your party in Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and Siege of Dragonspear. A self-proclaimed warrior-storyteller, Ophysia has journeyed to Nashkel to help put a stop to the iron crisis. While she masks many of her vulnerabilities with teasing nonchalance, she’s driven by a deep-seated desire to do good in the world and live life to the fullest.

Ophysia can be found in the Belching Dragon Tavern in Nashkel, sharing tales and drinks with her fellow patrons. In Siege of Dragonspear, she can be recruited in the city of Baldur’s Gate.
